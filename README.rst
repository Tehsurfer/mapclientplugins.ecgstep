ECG step
======
The ecg step is a plugin for the MAP Client application that registers ECG data to 3D models. The ECG data is sourced from a [Blackfynn](https://www.blackfynn.com "Blackfynn Homepage") acount (a cloud storage platform) and linked to the model to view and export to the webGL viewer (the in-broswer version).
